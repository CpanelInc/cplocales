How to Use These Locales
=========================

cPanel locales are a combination of a Perl module and a string library.
To use the community provided locales you need to install both on your
cPanel & WHM server.

Simple Outline
--------------

1. Download the contents of community-locales to your local server
2. Copy the perl modules to /usr/local/cpanel/Cpanel/Locale
3. Copy the .yaml files to /var/cpanel/locale.local
4. Run /usr/local/cpanel/bin/build_locale_databases --clean

The new locales are now available for users to select.
