# Introduction
cPanel officially supports English, Spanish, German, and Russian. In the future, we plan to add support for additional languages as new translations become available. This is part of an ongoing effort to provide the best and most accurate translations possible.

In previous versions, we provided partial language support for other languages. In cPanel & WHM v106, we removed partial language support for these other languages. To reinstate partial language support, use the files in this repository. A server administrator can make them available.

## Uploading Languages to a Server
To upload any of the language files found here, perform the steps found in our [Locale Upload](https://go.cpanel.net/whmdocsLocaleXMLUpload) documentation.
